      <h3>About me</h3>
      <dd>
        Hello, I am Emmanuel Michael, and I'm a student at Altschool>>software
        engineering>>Front-End engineering. My student ID is ALT/SOE/023/2197,
        and I'd love to share a bit about my journey at Altschool, my
        motivations, and what I hope to achieve here.<br />

        I enrolled in Altschool because I'm passionate about software
        engineering and the endless possibilities it offers in today's rapidly
        evolving technological landscape. Altschool, with its reputation for
        fostering innovation, creativity, and a hands-on approach to learning,
        seemed like the perfect place for me to develop my skills and knowledge
        in this field.

        expertise have been invaluable on this educational journey. Thank you
        for your dedication and for helping us grow as aspiring software
        engineers.

      <h3>So Far</h3>
      <dd>
        So far, My journey in Altschool has been an exciting one. The remote
        learning environment has been incredibly flexible, allowing me to
        balance my studies with other commitments. I've had the privilege of
        learning from some of the brightest minds in the software engineering
        world through online lectures, virtual labs, and engaging discussions.
        Altschool's emphasis on real-world projects has given me the opportunity
        to apply what I've learned to practical situations, and I've been
        fortunate to collaborate with amazing mates from Slack.
      </dd>
      <h3>My Goal as an Altschooler</h3>
      <dd>
        My primary goal is to become a proficient software engineer capable of
        creating innovative solutions to complex problems. I want to gain a deep
        understanding of various cloud services, development tools, and
        best practices. Furthermore, I aim to build a diverse portfolio of
        projects that showcase my skills and demonstrate my ability to adapt to
        different technologies and work on multidisciplinary teams.
      </dd>
      <h3>Personal Growth</h3>
      <dd>
        In addition to technical skills, Altschool also encourages personal
        growth and development. I aspire to become a well-rounded individual,
        capable of effective communication, teamwork, and problem-solving.
        Altschool's emphasis on these soft skills is helping me become a more
        effective software engineer, ready to contribute meaningfully to the
        industry.
